I know replace vehicles don’t work so well with FiveM, or at least they didn’t… Me and my friends kind of like a lot of them and wouldn’t mind going through the trouble of a few crashes to play with those, but they got a little bit excessive, so we stopped.

When I saw that tennis-stairway-seven had been squashed I figured I should give this a try, since that was our biggest problem. I’ve still crashed once with this car pack since I put it together for FiveM and I believe there might be more problem vehicles in it, I just don’t have time to test it thoroughly, but apparently the crashes now tell us which vehicle is the one causing problems, all I had to do was remove the files for that vehicle from the stream folder, it was easy to fix and I hope if any more problems appear it will be as easy the last one.

Anyhow… Here is the Download link MEGA 9.6k

The download size is about 2.8GB so I can’t really post a virus total link, and I don’t really have any anti-virus, so if anyone could please post a virus scan for me I’d be very grateful!

I didn’t made any of these vehicles. Or put the car pack together. I just made it a resource for FiveM by extracting the files contained on the .oiv provided in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIjFIEMdwWU 9.7k
